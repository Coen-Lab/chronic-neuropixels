# Apollo Implant Parts List and Instructions
## Parts List
In this repository are all the parts required to build the chronic implant (not including glue, dental cement, etc.).
Files are adjustable using annotated parameter tables. Please watch “SupplementaryVideo_1.mp4” (found here) if you are unfamiliar with this process. You will also need Autodesk Inventor which is free for educational use. This allows you to, for example, change the angle of the docking module, spacing between probes, or thickness of the walls. However, be aware that parameters like “length of exposed probes” are estimates based on our own use and not exact. The default values are those we use in the lab for a typical insertion, although we change them as needed.

Files are also inter-linked, such that changes you make to the parameters of Payload_NP1 will cause changes in Docking_NP1, and DockingHolder_NP1. Usually, these are changes you want because it means all the parts will fit together. However, you should be aware that these are happening, and can be overridden if needed.

Files specific to versions 1 and 2 of Neuropixels are in NP1 and NP2 folders. Other parts are in the base folder and can be used (in some cases with a parameter change) for either version. 

### “Payload_NP1” or “Payload_NP2”
This is the module that holds the probe(s). You will need one of these for each probe (or pair of probes) you use, and it is re-used across implantations. Print in Natural Rigid Resin 4000, including 4x M1 threaded inserts.
