# Community-driven additional parts
In this folder, you will find parts generated by members of the Neuropixels community. The folder indicates the primary use of the part. Some of these will not be published, and may no longer be in active use. Please contact the designer listed if you have any questions.

## Have a part to upload?
If you have a part to upload, please _submit a pull request_. In the interests of the community, please include the following in your commit:
1. Add files to the folder that matches your use-case: Animal_State (e.g. Mouse_Headfixed or Rat_FreelyMoving). If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it (e.g. Platypus_FreelySwimming... I can hope).
2. Add _one_ file per part and name the file according to ProbeType_Function (e.g. NP1_HeadstageHolder).
3. Add parts in an editable format where possible _IF_ the software used is freely accessable to those in educational institutions. This will allow other members of the community to adjust the parts to their needs. Otherwise, upload a standard CAD format (e.g. STP or STL).
4. Edit the README to include:
   * Sub-heading with the same name as your file.
   * A description of the part and how you use it.
   * One or two (but no more) images of the part.
   * The material that you typically use to print the part.
   * Your contact details.
