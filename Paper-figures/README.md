Code to replicate the figures of our [eLife paper](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/98522). The accompanying dataset is [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Dataset_for_Bimbard_et_al_2024/27652932?file=50358252).

Use function `figuresForPaper` to replicate each figure. The code for the tracking (Fig. 5) is not shared here but UnitMatch can be found [here](https://github.com/EnnyvanBeest/UnitMatch).

Note that the function `saveDataForPaper` will not work for you. It is here FYI.
